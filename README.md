# Task Manager

This Python script is a simple command-line task manager that allows users to manage a list of tasks. You can add new tasks, view existing tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. 

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Allows the user to add a new task to the task list.
- **View Tasks**: Lists all tasks with their current completion status (✅ for completed, ❌ for incomplete).
- **Mark Task as Completed**: Marks a specific task as done.
- **Delete Task**: Removes a specific task from the task list.
  
## How It Works

The script offers a simple menu system:
1. **Add New Task**: Prompts the user to input a new task.
2. **View My Tasks**: Displays the current tasks, where you can choose to either mark a task as complete or delete it.
3. **Quit**: Exits the program.
